## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can identify fake profiles on social media platforms. Fake profiles can be created for various reasons, including spamming, spreading misinformation, or conducting fraudulent activities. By detecting and flagging such profiles, it becomes easier to maintain the integrity and security of online communities.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- `fake.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for fake profile detection.
- `insta_test.csv`: CSV file containing test data for evaluating the model.
- `insta_train.csv`: CSV file containing training data for building the model.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vimalveeramani/fake_profile_detection.git`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `fake.ipynb` using Jupyter or a compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and detect fake profiles.
